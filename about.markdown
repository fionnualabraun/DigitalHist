Fionnuala Braun is a researcher and graduate student at Carleton University, with a BA (Hons.) in history from the University of Saskatchewan. Her thesis focuses on the creation of socio-sexual identities in France’s homosexual clubs during the 1950s, but she is also interested in the intersections of social, political, and personal circumstances on public health outcomes.
